# Heap-Structure
A basic implementation of a Heap Data Structure with basic functions for building max and min Heap. Basic implementation of a Heap Data Structure with basic functions for priority queues.

The code, the functions and the theory behind the structure comes from the book: "Introduction of Algorithms and Data Structures" fourth edition.

This is just a little implementation test that i'm doing to improve my coding skills.
